    As an alternative or extension to traditional interactive points (shopping malls, museums, airports, etc.), a Smart Point of Interaction use technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy or Wi-Fi to bring new interactions to user's devices (smartphones, wearables, etc.).

    A smart point of interaction is composed mainly by two entities: "Smart Point of Interaction": defines an
    interactive point which provides information, entertainment or co-creation tools to citizens.
    Optionally it can reference a related smart city asset with enriched interaction provided by this technology.
    "Smart Spot": a set of resources related to a physical device and the technology to provide a Smart Point of Interaction.
